It was during this time a massive meteorite made of a sound and energy absorbing mineral, which would later be known as vibranium crashed to Earth. One of the tribes, led by Bashenga, its mightiest warrior, decided to investigate, believing this to be a gift from the gods. Bashenga prayed to the Panther God to give him the strength to defeat these demons, becoming the first Black Panther and uniting the tribes to form the nation of Wakanda. His lineage would later rule the country for centuries. Now you, T'Challa, are the latest to sit upon his throne.",
